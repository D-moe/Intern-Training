    I was born in Sacramento, CA and have spent most of my life living there. Ever since I was little I have
    been interested
    in building and experimenting with different things, working on crafts with my mom and spending lots of time
    figuring out how I can fit projects together.
    In high school I joined an FRC team (robotics team) where I discovered my passion for programming and lead
    the team to many successful competitions. I am currently
    a rising junior at UCLA where I am involved in the UAS team (drone club) and also pursue research in NLP
    through the Intel AI Student Ambassadors program.

    For fun I enjoy spending as much time as possible with my lovely dog, Bailee (I am a huge animal lover) as
    well as attending as many sporting events as I can. I love going
    with a group of friends to all UCLA's basketball and football as we root them on even when our teams are not
    the best. When I'm pursuing these activities I like to spend time
    working on OS and hardware projects, building a server for my home and trying to buy old computers to use in
    new systems around my house. I also enjoy juggling (which my AP Calc teacher in high school required us to learn as a fun activity)
    and am proud of the fact that I am able to juggle 4 balls simultaneously, which I thought I should learn as it looks cool.
