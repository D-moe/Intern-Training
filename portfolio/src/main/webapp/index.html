            I was born in Sacramento, CA and have spent most of my life living there. Ever since I was little I have
            been interested
            in building and experimenting with different things, working on crafts with my mom and spending lots of time
            figuring out how I can fit projects together.
            In high school I joined an FRC team (robotics team) where I discovered my passion for programming and lead
            the team to many successful competitions. I am currently
            a rising junior at UCLA where I am involved in the UAS team (drone club) and also pursue research in NLP
            through the Intel AI Student Ambassadors program

            For fun I enjoy spending as much time as possible with my lovely dog, Bailee (I am a huge animal lover) as
            well as attending as many sporting events as I can. I love going
            with a group of friends to all UCLA's basketball and football as we root them on even when our teams are not
            the best. When I'm pursuing these activities I like to spend time
            working on OS and hardware projects, building a server for my home and trying to buy old computers to use in
            new systems around my house.
